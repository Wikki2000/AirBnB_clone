# AirBnB clone - The console:
The Airbnb-Console project aims to develop a command-line tool that serves as a powerful storage system for managing and persisting objects related to Airbnb listings. This console tool provides a user-friendly interface for users to create, update, delete, and query Airbnb listings, without the need to directly interact with the underlying storage mechanism.

# Dscription of the command interpreter:
A command interpreter, often referred to as a command-line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer system or program. It allows users to input commands via a text prompt, which are then interpreted and executed by the system or application. The command interpreter then processes these commands and returns the appropriate outputs or performs the requested actions.

#### <b> HERE'S HOW A COMMAND INTERPRETER WORKS: </b>

1. Input: Users type commands into the command interpreter, typically by typing them directly into a terminal window or console.<br><br>
2. Interpretation: The command interpreter receives these commands and interprets them based on predefined syntax rules. It understands the structure and semantics of the commands it supports<br><br>
3. Processing: After interpreting the commands, the interpreter takes appropriate actions. This could involve executing system-level commands, running scripts, launching programs, or performing various tasks within the interpreter itself.<br><br>
4. Output: Once the commands are executed or processed, the interpreter may generate output to provide feedback to the user. This output could be text-based messages, data results, error notifications, or any other relevant information.<br><br>
5. Feedback Loop: The command interpreter typically continues to run in a loop, waiting for new commands from the user. It processes each command sequentially, responding to each one before moving on to the next.<br>
