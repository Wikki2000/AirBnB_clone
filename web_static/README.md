#  AirBnB clone - Web static
## Introduction:
This project is a part of the AirBnB clone series, focusing on building the front-end user interface for the application. The goal is to create a simple static web page that represents the listing page of a property rental website, similar to AirBnB.

## Project Description:
In this project, we develop the front-end of the AirBnB clone application using HTML and CSS. The main objective is to create a static representation of the AirBnB listing page, including the header, footer, and property listings.

## Project Structure:

index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the web page, including the header, footer, and property listings.
styles/: This directory contains CSS files used to style the web page. It includes files for global styles, header styles, footer styles, and property listing styles.
images/: This directory contains images used in the project, such as property photos and icons.

## Installation:
Since this project is a static web page, there is no installation required. Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to view the web page.
